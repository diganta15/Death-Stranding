The former-coroner-now-doctor Deadman appears and introduces himself, then with a twist of his wrist, loosens Sam's cuffs and freeing him. When Sam asks on the purpose of the handcuffs, Deadman replies that they are cutting-edge devices meant to keep everyone in Bridges connected. He then guides Sam into properly integrating himself with the cuffs. To Sam's shock, the holographic display shows that he had been unconscious for two whole days in the safe house. Deadman then confesses that during that period, fluid samples from Sam had been collected due to his special status as a repatriate. Sam then inquires about the status of the Corpse Disposal team, which Deadman regretfully replies that Central Knot City had been completely obliterated from the voidout, and that the only survivors were Sam and his Bridge Baby.`,
